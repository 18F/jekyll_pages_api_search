## jekyll_pages_api_search Plugin

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/18F/jekyll_pages_api_search.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/18F/jekyll_pages_api_search)

This Ruby gem adds a [lunr.js](http://lunrjs.com) search index to a
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)-based web site.

The search index is generated and compressed automatically via `jekyll build`
or `jekyll serve`. The supporting JavaScript code is optimized, compressed,
and loads asynchronously. These features ensure that the preparation of the
search index does not introduce rendering latency in the browser.

result receives the tab index, making mouse-based navigation unnecessary.

## How it works

On the server building the site, the plugin takes the corpus produced by the
[`jekyll_pages_api` gem](https://github.com/18F/jekyll_pages_api/) and feeds
it to a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) script that compiles it into a lunr.js
index, serialized as JSON. The plugin adds this output file to the Jekyll site
output. It generates a compressed copy as well, enabling web servers to take
advantage of sending the compressed output directly, e.g. using the [Nginx
`gzip_static on` directive](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_gzip_static_module.html).

The gem also generates a (configurable, customizable) search results page that
will serve the search results.

On the client, the search interface box submits a query form that fetches the
search results page. The code on the search results page then fetches the
search index from the server (which will be cached by the browser until the
next site build). After loading the index, the page issues the query and
inserts the results into its search results interface element.

All of the client-side components are bundled together with
`assets/js/search.js` into `assets/js/search-bundle.js` using
[Browserify](http://browserify.org/).

## Installation

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) on your system. This plugin requires
   version 4.2 or greater or version 5 or greater. You may wish to first install a
   version manager such as [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to manage and install different Node.js versions.


1. Add this line to your Jekyll project's `Gemfile`:
  ```ruby
  group :jekyll_plugins do
    gem 'jekyll_pages_api_search'
  end
  ```

1. Add the following to the project's `_config.yml` file:

  ```yaml
  # Configuration for jekyll_pages_api_search plugin gem.
  jekyll_pages_api_search:
    # Uncomment this to speed up site generation while developing.
    #skip_index: true

    # Each member of `index_fields` should correspond to a field generated by
    # the jekyll_pages_api. It can hold an optional `boost` member as a signal
    # to Lunr.js to weight the field more highly (default is 1).
    index_fields:
      title:
        boost: 10
      tags:
        boost: 10
      url:
        boost: 5
      body:
  ```

1. Run `jekyll build` or `jekyll serve` to produce `search-index.json` and
   `search-index.json.gz` files in the `_site` directory (or other output
   directory, as configured).

1. If you're running [Nginx](http://nginx.org), you may want to use the
   [`gzip_static on`
   directive](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_gzip_static_module.html)
   to take advantage of the gzipped versions of the search index and supporting
   JavaScript.

## Usage

To add the index to your pages, insert the following tags in your `_layouts`
and `_includes` files as you see fit:

- `{% jekyll_pages_api_search_interface %}`: inserts the HTML for the search
  box and search results
- `{% jekyll_pages_api_search_load %}`: inserts the `<script>` tags to load
  the search code asynchronously; the search code will then load
  `search-index.json` asynchronously

You can also add `@import "jekyll_pages_api_search";` to one of your [Sass
assets](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/assets/) to use the default interface style.

Add `skip_index: true` to the front matter of any documents you would like to
exclude from the index (e.g. indexes that contain summaries of other documents).

## Configuration

In addition to the fields listed above in the [installation
instructions](#installation), the following properties of the
`jekyll_pages_api_search` configuration object are also available:

- **results_page_title**: Sets the title of the generated search results page.
- **layout**: The name of the layout file for the search results page, minus
  the `.html` suffix. By default this is `search-results`, and is provided by
  the plugin. If you add a `search-results.html` to your site's `layout_dir`
  (typically `_layouts`), the plugin will use that layout instead.
- **endpoint**: The name of the endpoint generated for the search results
  page. Defaults to `search`.

## Customization

If you prefer to craft your own versions of these tags and styles, you can
capture the output of these tags and the Sass `@import` statement, then create
new tags or included files based on this output, careful not to change
anything that causes the interaction between these components to fail.

Alternately, you can inspect the code of this gem (all paths relative to
`lib/jekyll_pages_api_search/`):

- `{% jekyll_pages_api_search_interface %}`: includes `search.html`
- `{% jekyll_pages_api_search_load %}`: generated by the `LoadSearchTag` class
  from `tags.rb`
- `{% jekyll_pages_api_search_results %}`: generated by the `SearchResultsTag`
  class from `tags.rb`
- `@import "jekyll_pages_api_search";`: includes
  `sass/jekyll_pages_api_search.scss`

## Running standalone

If you wish to generate a `search-index.json` file (and optionaly a
`pages.json` file) when using a site generation tool other than Jekyll, you
can run the `jekyll_pages_api_search` executable as a post-generation step.
Run `jekyll_pages_api -h` for instructions.

## Developing

Install Node.js per the [installation instructions (step #1)](#installation).
The `Rakefile` will prompt you to install Node.js and any packages
that are missing from your system when running `bundle exec rake build`.

After cloning this repository, do the following to ensure your installation is
in a good state:

```sh
$ cd jekyll_pages_api_search
$ npm install
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec rake test
```

Run `bundle exec rake -T` to get a list of build commands and descriptions.

Commit an update to bump the version number of
`lib/jekyll_pages_api_search/version.rb` before running `bundle exec rake
release`.

While developing this gem, add this to the Gemfile of any project using the
gem to try out your changes (presuming the project's working directory is a
sibling of the gem's working directory):

```ruby
group :jekyll_plugins do
  gem 'jekyll_pages_api_search', :path => '../jekyll_pages_api_search'
end
```
